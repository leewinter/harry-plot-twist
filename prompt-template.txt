Reusable prompt for new security comics (VitePress):

```
Create a new security comic page in VitePress with this info:
- Topic/threat: <describe (e.g., A01:2021 Broken Access Control)>
- Character: <animal/name/personality>
- Title: <page title>
- Scenes: ~4 scenes with short captions + lessons per scene.
- Checklist: 4–5 concise bullet takeaways.

Implementation details:
- Add the page at docs/security/<slug>/index.md.
- Store image placeholders in docs/security/<slug>/images/ and reference them with Markdown image syntax: ![alt](./images/<file>.png).
- Add a link to the new page in docs/security/index.md under Featured Topics and in the Security Comics sidebar in docs/.vitepress/config.mjs.
- Keep text ASCII; no smart quotes/dashes.
- If images don’t exist, create empty placeholders (1x1 PNG) so links resolve.
```
